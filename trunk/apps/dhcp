# Just check for a valid BOOTP message, followed by DHCP magic cookie.
#
# This can now be improved by "Semantic Conditions" in Ragel (see
# section 6.5 in manual).  However, two notes: appid.c increases
# about 9000 lines, and DHCP, since it is always from 0.0.0.0 to
# 255.255.255.255 only shows up when pktengine times out the "connection"
#
# If pktengine included MAC address in the tuple for tracking connections,
# then this would work.  There is little value in doing so, however.
#
# Note also that the 'any*' term can be replaced with any{235}, but then
# appid.c grows by a factor of 3 or 4.
