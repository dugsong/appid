# rsync

# From csprotocol.txt:
#
#   This is the protocol used for rsync --daemon; i.e. connections to
#   port 873 rather than invocations over a remote shell.
#
#   When the server accepts a connection, it prints a greeting
#
#     @RSYNCD: <version>
#
#   where <version> is the numeric version; currently 24.  It follows
#   this with a free text message-of-the-day.  It expects to see a
#   similar greeting back from the client.
