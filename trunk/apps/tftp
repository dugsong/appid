# XXX - Match read (RRQ, opcode=1) and write (WRQ, opcode=2) requests only.  A
# TFTP request flow from "hostA:portY" to "hostB:69" will generate a response
# flow from "hostB:portZ" to "hostA:portY", where portZ is unknown.  What
# happens is that we only look for the RRQ and WRQ opcode here, and then
# pktengine will add an anticipated flow to its hash for the response flow.  We
# will then be able to properly identify TFTP packets with other opcodes (i.e.,
# 3=DATA, 4=ACK, 5=ERROR), which are otherwise too freeform to match on.
