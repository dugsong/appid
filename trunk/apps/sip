# XXX - It would be easier to match the server response instead of the client
# request (i.e., '"SIP/2.0 " digit{3} [^\r\n]* 0xd 0xa').  However, the initial
# client request packet may include SDP information that we need to decode in
# order to anticipate the RTP flows.  So we need to identify the SIP stream
# early enough to decode the RTP IP/port pair from the SDP information.
