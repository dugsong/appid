# Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
# RFC 3290 - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3920.txt
#
# XMPP sessions for client-server and server-server connections are
# started with a <stream:stream> tag and end appropriately with a 
# </stream:stream> tag.
#
# Implementations SHOULD send an XML text declaration before sending
# a stream header (Section 11.4).
#
# Sample: <?xml version="1.0"?>
# <stream:stream xmlns:stream="http://etherx.jabber.org/streams"
# xmlns="jabber:client" to="example.org">
