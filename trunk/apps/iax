# A NEW message is sent to initiate a call.  It is the first call-
# specific message sent to initiate an actual media exchange between
# two peers.  'NEW' messages are unique in that they do not require a
# destination call identifier in their header.  This absence is because
# the remote peer's source call identifier is not created until after
# receipt of this frame.  Before sending a NEW message, the local IAX
# peer MUST assign a source call identifier that is not currently being
# used for another call.  A time-stamp MUST also be assigned for the
# call, beginning at 0 and incrementing each millisecond.  Sequence
# numbers for a NEW message, described in the transport section, are
# both set to 0.

# A NEW message MUST include the 'version' IE, and it MUST be the first
# IE.

# The timestamp is the amount of time passed since the call was 
# initiated.  Since the NEW message is the first message sent in the 
# call, the timestamp is usually between 0-10 ms.  Assuming it is less
# than than 65536 ms is a very safe assumption.
