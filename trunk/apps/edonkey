# XXX - Packet data length is a DWORD (4 bytes), but since we're IP, a valid
# data length must be <= 65535.  So match only on the first two bytes, and
# assume the second two bytes are 0.  Additionally, it's not valid for both
# of the first two bytes to be 0.

# XXX - The UDP messages are too freeform to match on, so they are commented
# out for now.  The ipp2p project (http://www.ipp2p.org) got around this by
# matching valid op codes with packet lengths.  i.e., edonkey op code 0x96 is
# a "client -> server status request", and these UDP messages always have
# 14 bytes of payload.  We'll probably need this functionality in Ragel soon.
#

#
# XXX - Edonkey sends some smaller messages via UDP instead (I saw some packets
# with only 6 bytes of data).

# XXX - Overnet is a separate edonkey network that implements the Kademlia
# protocol (http://www.cs.rice.edu/Conferences/IPTPS02/109.pdf).  The
