# XXX - There may be more variants of the file transfer GET command.  The
# digit{1,10} part here matches a Gnutella "File Index" which is returned in
# QueryHit messages as a 32-bit integer.  When converted into an ASCII string,
# this number must be in the range of 1 to 10 characters wide.

#
# XXX - Gnutella sends some messages via UDP instead.  But the UDP format for
# Gnutella version 1 is probably too freeform for us to match on.  I did notice
# that the dst port for the TCP connections seems to be the src port that is
# used for the UDP messages to the same end host.  But using LimeWire, I saw
# some of those UDP packets *before* the TCP connection started, so it doesn't
# seem that watching the port values for the TCP connections would be a 100%
# reliable way to identify all of the Gnutella UDP messages.
#
# XXX - Note also that this sig would need to be moved to its own file as
# part of the 'any' machine, should it ever be enabled.
