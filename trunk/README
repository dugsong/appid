Appid is a passive application protocol identification library that
implements a state machine for efficient pattern matching of
regex-like application content signatures.

It uses the excellent Ragel finite state machine compiler to compile
multiple patterns into a single combined machine for one-pass
evaluation of a given input stream.

For more information about the signature format, library internals,
and general hacking, see the HACKING file in this distribution.

Appid is an open-source contribution of Arbor Networks' technology to
the community many of its developers came from. For licensing
information, please see the LICENSE file in this distribution.

Building
--------

To build and install the library:

	./configure	(add '--with-python' to build Python module)
	make
	sudo make install

The ragel-generated appid.c takes a lot of memory to compile. If you
run into a compiler error like "virtual memory exhausted", you may
need to increase your resource limits before compiling with "unlimit"
(*csh) or "ulimit" (*sh).
